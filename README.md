# SplendorJS
 Splendor but Made with JS and 1000x Worse!
 
 Hello to whoever may be reading this! This is a quick project I thought I'd make to test my newly learned JavaScript, HTML, and CSS skills. I made a copy of my favorite board game, "Splendor", that could be played through the browser locally with another person. Unfortunately, I haven't found a way to play online with another person but maybe that will be something I add on another day...
 
 P.S: I hope the window works ok for whoever decides to play it. I looks fine on my screen but my knowledge of breakpoints and sizing HTML elements proportionally is pretty abysmal so knock yourself out.
