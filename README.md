# SplendorJS
 Splendor but made with JS!
 
 Hello to whoever may be reading this! This is a quick project I thought I'd make to test my newly learned JavaScript, HTML, and CSS skills. I made a copy of my favorite board game, "Splendor", that could be played through the browser locally with another person. Unfortunately, I haven't found a way to play online with another person yet but maybe that will be something I add on a later date...
 
 So far I've implemented turn by turn token selection, an end turn button, and an undo button. As of my last update, I created a program to enter the card information into, which stores the data as a JSON file that I will access later. I still have a lot of work to do with implementing cards, reserving, score checking, noble checking, etc.

 <h4>TAKEAWAYS:</h4>
 HTML: Using Bootstrap, Refresher\
 CSS: Refresher\
 JavaScript: Promises, Async/Await, JSON Data Storage, Object Manipulation
 
 P.S: I hope the window works ok for whoever decides to play it. I looks fine on my screen but my knowledge of breakpoints and sizing HTML elements proportionally is pretty abysmal so knock yourself out.
